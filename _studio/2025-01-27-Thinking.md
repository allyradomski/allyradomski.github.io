## Studio setup

To setup speaker experiments, I cleared out a space in the studio of an unused desk. I then set up 4 speakers on tripod stands with added plate attachments (thank you Gillian). Trying to make it as neat as I could, I ziptied the power cables and audio cables in the speakers along the tripod stands and linked it the UltraLite-mk5 audio interface. The black/red cables connecting the left and right speakers of a duo are quite short which would lead to trip hazard, I have messaged Neil about potential of buying longer cables. Conveniently, the windowsill lets my Kinect camera sit there, which will be useful for testing ideas.

I think the work in progress show will involve getting things working the way I want them. For that reason, I won't think about potential walls and curtains and decoration for now. I have some ideas, my friend suggested an enclosure like Rirkrit Tiravanija's [Untitled](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1987959). I was also discussing with a friend how to repurpose a gazebo or something similar. In the actual exhibition, I'd want to probably hide the speakers somehow as the focus will be on the experience, not the technology.

## Ableton experiments

I want to pursue the idea of chopping up/granulating long recordings without picking and choosing what samples to use. I will record a few more experiences of me just walking around places, both urban and natural. This'll allow a diverse amount of sonic material to play with.

In one of my previous posts, I did an experiment trying to procedurally receive random parts of a long sample. This didn't work too well. I think it was too much load for the CPU and it evoked sound glitches (popping/clicking). I wanted to experiment with another method.

### Splitting audio files

Using FFmpeg, I made a program using Mac's Shortcuts app that lets me select a file, a destination and segment duration. It then quickly splits the audio file into lots of little chunks that I can import into Ableton.

### Sampler Instrument

I experimented with various different devices that let me use numerous different samples. First, I looked on maxforlive.com for devices that'd help. I found a [Random Sample Picker](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/11083/random-sample-picker) but an issue I see with this is that it's $6, and it doesn't let me change the start time of the audio file. The reason for splitting the files wasn't to give discrete sounds, but let me able to jump around anywhere in a long audio file. 

Sampler only lets me have one audio file so that won't work.

Next I experimented with the Drum Rack instrument and loaded all my split samples into it. It played the samples fine, but didn't let me change the start time easily. Same problem as that MaxForLive device. Essentially I had Simpler in each Drum Pad but it would be difficult and tedious to do hundreds of mappings to change the start time of each one. 

Sampler looked the most promising, it lets me load lots of different samples into it and play them individually. This works by mapping out different "Zones" to play depending on the key. Initially I thought it had the same problem as before, just that it seemed neater as one device, but I figured it out.

First, the samples warped depending on the note played. This isn't what I wanted, I didn't want it to be treated like a piano, but like a drum sampler. This was as easy as selecting all the samples in the Zones tab and turning "Scale" -> "0%". This fixed it for the most part, except it still has issues when you go below C2.

Next, I needed to figure out how to change the start time of each sample. Sampler has a neat feature in the "MIDI" tab that lets me map velocity to "Sample Offset". Therefore, using a "Velocity" MIDI device, I can change this easily to change where the sample starts. This lets me vary each sample chunk. The benefit of Sampler too is that it is just one device instead of duplicating it for every sample. I assume this makes it run smoother.

Repeating a short MIDI sequence makes it into a rhythm. It was quite nice to play around with, though I don't think that's what I want to achieve fully in the WIP. I want it more continual and procedural, though it could be interesting to have some repeated bits. 

### E4L

Going further with this, I linked it up to the quad speaker set up and played around for a while changing parameters and experimenting what results I could get from it. I imagined different states of a creature, like a more relaxed state being longer parts of samples cutting out the lower frequencies. Though, thinking about it this way assigns sort of human emotions onto it, which isn't necessarily wrong. It'd be cool if even I didn't know what this "creature" was thinking.
