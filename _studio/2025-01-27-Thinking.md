## Studio setup

To setup speaker experiments, I cleared out a space in the studio of an unused desk. I then set up 4 speakers on tripod stands with added plate attachments (thank you Gillian). Trying to make it as neat as I could, I ziptied the power cables and audio cables in the speakers along the tripod stands and linked it the UltraLite-mk5 audio interface. The black/red cables connecting the left and right speakers of a duo are quite short which would lead to trip hazard, I have messaged Neil about potential of buying longer cables. Conveniently, the windowsill lets my Kinect camera sit there, which will be useful for testing ideas.

I think the work in progress show will involve getting things working the way I want them. For that reason, I won't think about potential walls and curtains and decoration for now. I have some ideas, my friend suggested an enclosure like Rirkrit Tiravanija's [Untitled](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1987959). I was also discussing with a friend how to repurpose a gazebo or something similar. In the actual exhibition, I'd want to probably hide the speakers somehow as the focus will be on the experience, not the technology.

## Ableton experiments

I want to pursue the idea of chopping up/granulating long recordings without picking and choosing what samples to use. I will record a few more experiences of me just walking around places, both urban and natural. This'll allow a diverse amount of sonic material to play with.

In one of my previous posts, I did an experiment trying to procedurally receive random parts of a long sample. This didn't work too well. I think it was too much load for the CPU and it evoked sound glitches (popping/clicking). I wanted to experiment with another method.

### Splitting audio files

Using FFmpeg, I made a program using Mac's Shortcuts app that lets me select a file, a destination and segment duration. It then quickly splits the audio file into lots of little chunks that I can import into Ableton.

### Sampler Instrument

I experimented with various different devices that let me use numerous different samples. First, I looked on maxforlive.com for devices that'd help. I found a [Random Sample Picker](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/11083/random-sample-picker) but an issue I see with this is that it's $6, and it doesn't let me change the start time of the audio file. The reason for splitting the files wasn't to give discrete sounds, but let me able to jump around anywhere in a long audio file. 

Sampler only lets me have one audio file so that won't work.

Next I experimented with the Drum Rack instrument and loaded all my split samples into it. It played the samples fine, but didn't let me change the start time easily. Same problem as that MaxForLive device. Essentially I had Simpler in each Drum Pad but it would be difficult and tedious to do hundreds of mappings to change the start time of each one. 

Sampler looked the most promising, it lets me load lots of different samples into it and play them individually. This works by mapping out different "Zones" to play depending on the key. Initially I thought it had the same problem as before, just that it seemed neater as one device, but I figured it out.

First, the samples warped depending on the note played. This isn't what I wanted, I didn't want it to be treated like a piano, but like a drum sampler. This was as easy as selecting all the samples in the Zones tab and turning "Scale" -> "0%". This fixed it for the most part, except it still has issues when you go below C2.

Next, I needed to figure out how to change the start time of each sample. Sampler has a neat feature in the "MIDI" tab that lets me map velocity to "Sample Offset". Therefore, using a "Velocity" MIDI device, I can change this easily to change where the sample starts. This lets me vary each sample chunk. The benefit of Sampler too is that it is just one device instead of duplicating it for every sample. I assume this makes it run smoother.

Repeating a short MIDI sequence makes it into a rhythm. It was quite nice to play around with, though I don't think that's what I want to achieve fully in the WIP. I want it more continual and procedural, though it could be interesting to have some repeated bits. 

### E4L

Going further with this, I linked it up to the quad speaker set up and played around for a while changing parameters and experimenting what results I could get from it. I imagined different states of a creature, like a more relaxed state being longer parts of samples cutting out the lower frequencies. Though, thinking about it this way assigns sort of human emotions onto it, which isn't necessarily wrong. It'd be cool if even I didn't know what this "creature" was thinking. 

## Mac Mini Setup

I decided to use the Mac Mini M1 for this project after advice from Daniel Neil to not focus on technical side (I was thinking cheap windows mini PC and PureData for point of lightweightedness), I started setting up the Mac Mini. I downloaded Ableton Live Suite 12 for sound. BlackHole to allow me to record audio from tests. UltraLite-mk5 drivers for the audio. The installations along with the WiFi connection required admin passwords but that was simple enough!

## ControlP5 + Open Kinect + MidiBus

I have been thinking about how I want the Processing program to control Ableton and read from the Kinect. I imagine it'll require quite a bit of fine tuning for how I want it to be and experimenting with values. I figured it could make it easier if I made the Processing program show me what values are going in and happening and maybe I could even change some on the fly.

I remember seeing a user interface library for Processing, and yes, it's called [ControlP5](https://sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/). Some brief brainstorming leads me to ideas of different knobs for the CC controls, maybe each with a lock that lets me control them manually or allow the program to do so. I also will need to control Ableton's transport buttons from it too, like sending a CC message to start playback. I'm not fully sure how I will automatically launch both Processing and Ableton automatically as soon as PC starts. I know there are Log In items.

### Open Kinect Problems and Solutions

Setting up the [Open Kinect For Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing) library was a little difficult, I was getting errors not being able to load certain libraries. Thankfully when looking through the "Issues" tab on the Github page, I found people with similar problems. A [solution](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/issues/168) to part of the problem was running the Intel version of Processing, thank you j3nsykes (I assume this is the previous tutor!). 
Another issue was missing libraries for jna.jar. The [solution](https://discourse.processing.org/t/processing-4-openkinect/32781/9) was opening the Intel Processing app and copy some .jar files around.

### Past MidiBus issue

In the past I had problems with connecting Virtual MIDI bus to Ableton, even though it was being detected in the status indicator, it wouldn't connect. I still don't know what the issue was but I suspect it was some update that fixed it since I upgraded to Ableton 12 and it works well now.

### ControlP5 Problem and Solution

At one point in programming the "control panel" system, it'd give a very bizzare error message that I didn't understand. It happened when adding functions to read controller changes from a knob. After some tinkering, I realise I accidentally made a loop that caused the issue. Changing a knob -> Reading a knob -> Writing to the knob. I didn't need to write to it again.

### Video test

I created this control panel I dub the "Creature Controller", a play on CC. So far I am able to modify 8 different CC values that are sent to Ableton. I added a little lock button that stops changes. This also links up to the little Akai LPD8 controller. The Start and Stop buttons are linked to CC1 and CC2 which is then linked inside Ableton to start and stop it. This could be done automatically upon program open. There is a camera view with toggles to switch between Colour view and Depth view. The camera then controls a slider depending on movement (similar to my previous experiments). The camera can also be tilted with a slider which makes it easier to test the movement detection function with.

</div>

This looks promising. I'm imaging it'll grow with more interconnected buttons and functions that'll let me fine-tune and test the "Creature".
