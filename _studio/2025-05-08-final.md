# Initial Thoughts

After discussion through feedback during the WIP show and a recent tutorial with Paul, I think I am confident to pursue the final piece. 

I would like to make a sound artwork of "scattered" speakers. These speakers would be different, almost like a collection of different species of speakers in a biome. Monitors, subwoofers, desktop speakers, headphones... I would like to connect them up to play found recorded sound from different locations. I want them to almost chat to each other and be linked. I am imagining a single power cable coming down from above into the centre, with the innards showing (the Mac, the audio interface, the wires..). This can be inferred as it as an entity or ecosystem being run on it's own, with only one power cable provided. 

I had worked on a p5js prototype/sketch a year ago that consists of connections and nodes and travellers that can navigate a network and play sound with triggers. This generated sounds in an almost organic way. There were patterns but it also couldn't really be predicted.

# Sound Capture / Ideas

## Idea 1
I wanted to assign specific sounds to each speaker/speaker set that I record from different places around Glasgow. This'll support the idea of it being an ecosystem that lives and speakers to one another.

I went to my local park (which is quite an important place for me) and recorded for an hour with headphones on. I was interacting with lots of different objects to create sounds in different ways. I used a microphone that lets me mark positions in the recording, which will make it easier to parse it. 

For my WIP, I recorded long audio and split it up and played it back randomly. I am going to experiment with how to parse the recorded audio. I may enforce limits on myself to make it easier. Perhaps 50 1 second audio clips from each location. I think this could be quite effective as it'll enhance the "it's being digitally played back" feeling. I could even put a gentle bit crush on it or downgrade the sound. The short clips could almost be like chirps sent between them.

## Idea 2
Another idea is to develop the idea of "An Array of Floating Ears". I imagine it as a 2D array, with first dimension as index of ear location, and second as time. 

At random slow intervals, the "location" could change and each speaker could play a random sector from that "ear".

## Conclusion

I have been thinking, and I still do very much like my original way of picking random parts of a recording to play back.

I want to give the sonic material space. An experiment of Idea 2 worked well. The sounds recordings shifted around, you could hear the different qualities that each clip had on each speaker. This demonstrates the variablity of speakers and how they impact the sound. Doing this also lets one specific sonic clip be explored by the audience in more detail. It isn't muddy, like the WIP.

I could collect numerous "floating ear" recordings, which it'll change through randomly and then pan with noise through the travellers. These could be exploratory recordings, or stationary recordings.

# Construction

Gillian suggested using scaffolding to create elevate the speakers and equipment from the ground. I do like the idea of this.  I drew a sketch of what I had an idea of for this. If this doesn't work out, plinths could work too.

# Collecting sounds online

I have had difficulty collecting sounds around Glasgow. It is quite tedious and it'll take a considerable amount of time to travel between different places to get varied recordings. Also, my microphone, the Zoom H1N, is great at picking some things up but not others.

I thought I could collect sounds online that other people have recorded. These recordings would be across the world and have varying microphones that captured it, enhancing the idea of technical characteristics. The speakers have character and the microphones that capture have character too. 

Freesound feels like an obvious choice, most of the sounds recorded seem like hobbiest recordings. They aren't "pristine" (quote on quote!) like sounds from libraries like Soundsnap. It feels raw. It also feels quite personal.

I was thinking about how I would filter through the mass sound library on freesound.org and I came up with some rules I could follow.

1. Only Geotagged sounds
    - This means only sounds existing in the world will appear. This should exclude synthesised sounds. I want recordings.
2. Minimum 20 seconds
    - I need room for the sound to be explored
3. Creative Commons 0
    - A license where I can do whatever with the sounds. I could use License that requires attirbution, but, I am not entirely sure of the crediting process. Would I only credit on my project webpage?
4. Seemingly no edits (except for trimming audio)

I could collect lots of these and then randomise what to use, but, I think I'll just go through the library and pick lots of different sounds.
