# Initial Thoughts

After discussion through feedback during the WIP show and a recent tutorial with Paul, I think I am confident to pursue the final piece. 

I would like to make a sound artwork of "scattered" speakers. These speakers would be different, almost like a collection of different species of speakers in a biome. Monitors, subwoofers, desktop speakers, headphones... I would like to connect them up to play found recorded sound from different locations. I want them to almost chat to each other and be linked. I am imagining a single power cable coming down from above into the centre, with the innards showing (the Mac, the audio interface, the wires..). This can be inferred as it as an entity or ecosystem being run on it's own, with only one power cable provided. 

This reminded me very much of an installation at Sonica 2024 at the CCA called [Umweltraum((a))](https://sonia-killmann.com/umweltrauma) by Sonia Killmann and Laura Mannelli. They created artifical creatures that react with sound.

I had worked on a p5js prototype/sketch a year ago that consists of connections and nodes and travellers that can navigate a network and play sound with triggers. This generated sounds in an almost organic way. There were patterns but it also couldn't really be predicted.

# Sound Capture / Ideas

## Idea 1
I wanted to assign specific sounds to each speaker/speaker set that I record from different places around Glasgow. This'll support the idea of it being an ecosystem that lives and speakers to one another.

I went to my local park (which is quite an important place for me) and recorded for an hour with headphones on. I was interacting with lots of different objects to create sounds in different ways. I used a microphone that lets me mark positions in the recording, which will make it easier to parse it. 

For my WIP, I recorded long audio and split it up and played it back randomly. I am going to experiment with how to parse the recorded audio. I may enforce limits on myself to make it easier. Perhaps 50 1 second audio clips from each location. I think this could be quite effective as it'll enhance the "it's being digitally played back" feeling. I could even put a gentle bit crush on it or downgrade the sound. The short clips could almost be like chirps sent between them.

## Idea 2
Another idea is to develop the idea of "An Array of Floating Ears". I imagine it as a 2D array, with first dimension as index of ear location, and second as time. 

At random slow intervals, the "location" could change and each speaker could play a random sector from that "ear".

## Conclusion

I have been thinking, and I still do very much like my original way of picking random parts of a recording to play back.

I want to give the sonic material space. An experiment of Idea 2 worked well. The sounds recordings shifted around, you could hear the different qualities that each clip had on each speaker. This demonstrates the variablity of speakers and how they impact the sound. Doing this also lets one specific sonic clip be explored by the audience in more detail. It isn't muddy, like the WIP.

I could collect numerous "floating ear" recordings, which it'll change through randomly and then pan with noise through the travellers. These could be exploratory recordings, or stationary recordings.

# Construction

Gillian suggested using scaffolding to create elevate the speakers and equipment from the ground. I do like the idea of this.  I drew a sketch of what I had an idea of for this. If this doesn't work out, plinths could work too.

After further discussion, Gillian recommended to use plinths to create a forest-like installation. Here is her sketch:

I do really like the idea of wires hanging between the speakers, almost like trees and vines.

# Collecting sounds online

I have had difficulty collecting sounds around Glasgow. It is quite tedious and it'll take a considerable amount of time to travel between different places to get varied recordings. Also, my microphone, the Zoom H1N, is great at picking some things up but not others.

I thought I could collect sounds online that other people have recorded. These recordings would be across the world and have varying microphones that captured it, enhancing the idea of technical characteristics. The speakers have character and the microphones that capture have character too. 

Freesound feels like an obvious choice, most of the sounds recorded seem like hobbiest recordings. They aren't "pristine" (quote on quote!) like sounds from libraries like Soundsnap. It feels raw. It also feels quite personal.

I was thinking about how I would filter through the mass sound library on freesound.org and I came up with some rules I could follow.

1. Only Geotagged sounds
    - This means only sounds existing in the world will appear. This should exclude synthesised sounds. I want recordings.
2. Minimum 20 seconds
    - I need room for the sound to be explored
3. Creative Commons 0
    - A license where I can do whatever with the sounds. I could use License that requires attirbution, but, I am not entirely sure of the crediting process. Would I only credit on my project webpage?
4. Seemingly no edits (except for trimming audio)

I could collect lots of these and then randomise what to use, but, I think I'll just go through the library and pick lots of different sounds.

## Trimming sounds & loading into Ableton

I loaded the samples downloaded into Ableton and cut them each down to 20 seconds at different positions of the audio. Then I saved these to a folder. After this I loaded the samples into a Sampler and put each sample at a different note.

# Setting up

I set up the equipment similar to the vision I got from Gillian's sketch. I connected it all up so it produces sounds. It was quite effective the way the different sound clips got "scattered" around the speakers.

<div class="row" style="padding: 10px;">

    <source src="{{ page.assetdir }}/constructing.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</div>

I asked for feedback from Gillian and she gave:
* Try making it a 360 experience
* Ditch the soundbar 
* Explore usage of more monitors.

After consideration and playing around with the setup I have come to these conclusions. I do really like the 360 aspect of setting it up, and ditching the soundbar was a good idea as it was too much a difficult shape and it seemed out of place somewhat. Though, I don't agree with more monitors, I really like the single monitor and how it's a singular window into an abstract way of how the system works. I feel more monitors would take over the stage of how different variabilities of sound.

I am really happy with the setup of this. I used the speaker wire as hanging at the top, and the speaker cables below as sort of floor foliage. I hung the two desktop speakers off wire, I do quite like it, but I am not sure if it looks tacky or not. I am very happy with the look of it.

# Painting and Photography

I painted the plinth I used, giving it a couple new coats of white paint to smoothen out the scuffs. 

<div class="row gy-4 justify-content-center">
<img src="{{page.assetdir}}/painting.jpg" class="col-6">
</div>

I want to dedicate a day to setting up my project in the Garage Space and take photos and recordings of it for this learning journal and the video. The walls are quite scuffed in the Garage, but I figured I will put it in the center of the Garage so the walls won't be that in focus anyway. I can paint over anything glaringly distracting. I could even focus the installation so that the background is slightly blurry.

# Checkpoint

I think I am pretty much almost happy with the work. I just want to add a few more recordings, add some tweaks and alter the node visuals. I am currently focusing on what I am going to write in the video. More so, getting a grasp of the context around my work. A lot of it is mixed up in my head and I need to get it down into legible words.

I called my Mum (as I often find it easier to figure stuff out with others!) and recorded the conversation. Transcribing it and putting it into ChatGPT to help me organise my words, I got quite good response with bits I can pick out and explain further in my own words with more nuance. As you can probably see, the response is still very ChatGPTy but it did help.

Project Summary – From an Array of Floating Ears

This project is an exploration of sonic textures, perception, and the unreliability of reproduced sound. Drawing from essays on hyperrealistic field recordings and the materiality of sound, it presents a dynamic sound installation composed of audio gathered from a wide range of sources — each recorded by different people, in different environments, using different equipment.

The sound is played through a scattered ecosystem of varied speakers, each with its own sonic character. The result is a living, shifting soundscape — not a realistic reproduction of a moment or place, but a layered reinterpretation, filtered through machines, space, and human intent.

Rather than editing the audio, the piece emphasizes how sound changes through every step of its journey: from the microphone that first captured it, to compression and upload, download, playback, and finally, the listener’s own perception. The technical elements — wires, speakers, exposed systems — are intentionally visible, forming part of the artwork's “organism” and reinforcing the idea that sound is never neutral or isolated.

_From an Array of Floating Ears_ imagines an invisible network of listening points — a three-dimensional web of ears scattered across the world, each absorbing fragments of lived experience. It invites the audience to simply listen. Not to search for meaning, but to notice. To consider sound as presence, and presence as layered, unstable, and rich with texture.

Video Script: _From an Array of Floating Ears_

_(Soft ambient sounds fade in — maybe fragments from the installation)_

[Ally – Voiceover]

When we listen to a sound recording, we’re not hearing a place.  
We’re hearing a version of it — filtered through a microphone, shaped by wind, compressed by software, and played back through a speaker with its own personality.

This project, _From an Array of Floating Ears_, is a sound installation made up of recordings I didn’t make.  
Instead, I collected audio from many sources — online archives, forgotten uploads, distant environments — each captured with different microphones, intentions, and contexts.

These fragments are played through an ecosystem of mismatched speakers.  
The wires are visible. The signals travel between nodes.  
It feels like a network — a kind of synthetic organism, or a web of ears, scattered and listening.

The sounds shift and move — never the same twice.  
A frog’s croak. A preacher’s voice. The hum of machinery. A distant conversation.  
Each speaker adds its own colour. Like someone else retelling a story they once heard.

The idea came from reading about hyperrealism in field recordings — how attempts to make things sound more “real” can actually flatten their depth.  
And from essays that treated sound not just as something to hear, but as a material — something you can shape, hold, question.

There’s no narrative here. No beginning or end. Just textures. Vibrations.  
I’m not trying to say something specific. I’m offering a space to listen — to let your mind wander, to hear sound as it is, and as it isn’t.

It’s not about accuracy.  
It’s about perception, distortion, and the beauty of imperfection.
