# Initial Thoughts

After discussion through feedback during the WIP show and a recent tutorial with Paul, I think I am confident to pursue the final piece. 

I would like to make a sound artwork of "scattered" speakers. These speakers would be different, almost like a collection of different species of speakers in a biome. Monitors, subwoofers, desktop speakers, headphones... I would like to connect them up to play found recorded sound from different locations. I want them to almost chat to each other and be linked. I am imagining a single power cable coming down from above into the centre, with the innards showing (the Mac, the audio interface, the wires..). This can be inferred as it as an entity or ecosystem being run on it's own, with only one power cable provided. 

I had worked on a p5js prototype/sketch a year ago that consists of connections and nodes and travellers that can navigate a network and play sound with triggers. This generated sounds in an almost organic way. There were patterns but it also couldn't really be predicted.
