## Selecting work

Potential candidates I have in mind that could be extended for the public audience are these projects. I also give little brief ideas.

* ✘ [Control](https://allyradomski.art/journal/control)
    - Possibly in some science museum, people could manipulate some values to warp a planet, they could then name it. This could go to another display that shows everyones planets. This audience interaction could both be a representation of differing ecology of planets and nature and also our own words, that being inside our heads.
* ✘ [Typographic Narratives (Sub-project with shrinking and expanding text)](https://allyradomski.art/journal/typographic-narratives) 
    - This could be in a public outside space. People could submit their "secrets" anonymously to appear on a display. When people get closer to it, the "secret" would shrink as if hiding or embarrassed. This could be about putting our secrets out in the world as some sort of relief. 
* ✔ [Audiovisual](https://allyradomski.art/journal/audiovisual) developed further [here](https://allyradomski.art/work/peacelove)
    - Similarly to typographic narratives idea, people could submit their writing to appear on screen. It could even go a step further and detect their hand writing and write it out as if it's their own. This could be layered with different images/videos people could submit and sounds these videos. This could be displayed in an intimate space such as a library. 

After some consideration, I am going to go with **Audiovisual** to develop further into a "pitch document". I continued work on it to show at an exhibition last year and I was proud how well it seemed to be received. People at one point formed a queue to see it, and people sitting in there sat and watched it for quite a while. I feel it could be even more engaging if you knew that the texts and visual/audio was submitted by people around you. 

## Learning InDesign

Adobe InDesign was the suggested program to use to create the document. I'm going to spend some time learning this. Currently I am a bit stuck on where to start, but there's a meeting on Thursday so that'll be helpful. I started an InDesign course on LinkedIn learning (cheeky 1 monh free trial) and it appears good so far! It is updated to 2024 and has lesson resources so that you can followo along. I feel I am picking it up fairly quickly. I found myself struggling with Adobe products like Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, I didn't feel it too intuitive, but it only seems to take a little while to learn the foundations of it.

## Feedback Session

I got valuable feedback from Cat and Paul during this feedback session. They were suggesting that I could utilise archives from libraries for the writing, which I think is a brilliant idea. This would be interesting to intermingle that idea with crowd-submitted writing, which could both have random writing appear. The idea of it floating along by, probably projected, was suggested. The benefits of doing this is that multiple people across the space can read the writing as it isn't focused at one location.

## Selecting a location

Finding a library with good space to do it is important. If all the walls of a library are lined with ornate stately details it may be difficult to find a space to display projections and whatnot, though it still could be done. Perhaps looking at previous exhibitons at libraries will give me an idea of spaces available. 

### British Library

I found these [images](https://www.northoverbrown.com/design/maps) of an Cartographer's Exhibition at the British Library. This was done by Northover&Brown, which seems to be a pretty good resource as they list all their works at different libraries and museums.

This shows the British Library has quite malleable spaces depending on the purpose.

### Heong Gallery

An [exhibition](https://heritagephotographs.com/libraries-at-heong/) in Cambridge had a photo series exhibition of 26 libraries in Cambridge. I thought of a possibility that maybe instead of being directly in a library, it could be in a space such as this and show off library collection archives of the surrounding libraries.

### Birmingham Library

Although not a seemingly obvious place, the installation could be installed so it appears on the underside of the escalators. There is lots of space for projections and such.

### Sir Duncan Rice Library

This library suggested by my friend has a lot of estate for imagery. Projections could be put on each level so people can read it from the bannisters.

## Feedback session

I had a tutorial with Gillian and we discussed different places in which it could be. We came to realise that spaces like Birmingham and Duncan Rice would not suit the locations as they lend themselves to passing through the locations that I suggested, like under the elevator. I would want it to be a static location, as I initially said that it is quite intimate and people seemed to be engaged with it when I presented it previously. 

Spaces such as V&A Dundee have extensive archives of many things, but it also includes book archives with would fit with what I want to do. 

I do need to select a space as a priority as I cannot start the rest of the project without doing so.
