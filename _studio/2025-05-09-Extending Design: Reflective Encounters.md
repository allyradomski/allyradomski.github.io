## Selecting work

Potential candidates I have in mind that could be extended for the public audience are these projects. I also give little brief ideas.

* [Control](https://allyradomski.art/journal/control)
    - Possibly in some science museum, people could manipulate some values to warp a planet, they could then name it. This could go to another display that shows everyones planets. This audience interaction could both be a representation of differing ecology of planets and nature and also our own words, that being inside our heads.
* [Typographic Narratives (Sub-project with shrinking and expanding text)](https://allyradomski.art/journal/typographic-narratives)
    - This could be in a public outside space. People could submit their "secrets" anonymously to appear on a display. When people get closer to it, the "secret" would shrink as if hiding or embarrassed. This could be about putting our secrets out in the world as some sort of relief. 
* [Audiovisual](https://allyradomski.art/journal/audiovisual)
    - Similarly to typographic narratives idea, people could submit their writing to appear on screen. It could even go a step further and detect their hand writing and write it out as if it's their own. This could be layered with different images people could submit, or even sounds somehow. This could be displayed in an intimate space such as a library.
