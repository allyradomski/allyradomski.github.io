## Selecting work

Potential candidates I have in mind that could be extended for the public audience are these projects. I also give little brief ideas.

* ✘ [Control](https://allyradomski.art/journal/control)
    - Possibly in some science museum, people could manipulate some values to warp a planet, they could then name it. This could go to another display that shows everyones planets. This audience interaction could both be a representation of differing ecology of planets and nature and also our own words, that being inside our heads.
* ✘ [Typographic Narratives (Sub-project with shrinking and expanding text)](https://allyradomski.art/journal/typographic-narratives) 
    - This could be in a public outside space. People could submit their "secrets" anonymously to appear on a display. When people get closer to it, the "secret" would shrink as if hiding or embarrassed. This could be about putting our secrets out in the world as some sort of relief. 
* ✔ [Audiovisual](https://allyradomski.art/journal/audiovisual) developed further [here](https://allyradomski.art/work/peacelove)
    - Similarly to typographic narratives idea, people could submit their writing to appear on screen. It could even go a step further and detect their hand writing and write it out as if it's their own. This could be layered with different images/videos people could submit and sounds these videos. This could be displayed in an intimate space such as a library. 

After some consideration, I am going to go with **Audiovisual** to develop further into a "pitch document". I continued work on it to show at an exhibition last year and I was proud how well it seemed to be received. People at one point formed a queue to see it, and people sitting in there sat and watched it for quite a while. I feel it could be even more engaging if you knew that the texts and visual/audio was submitted by people around you. 

## Learning InDesign

Adobe InDesign was the suggested program to use to create the document. I'm going to spend some time learning this. Currently I am a bit stuck on where to start, but there's a meeting on Thursday so that'll be helpful. I started an InDesign course on LinkedIn learning (cheeky 1 monh free trial) and it appears good so far! It is updated to 2024 and has lesson resources so that you can followo along. I feel I am picking it up fairly quickly. I found myself struggling with Adobe products like Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, I didn't feel it too intuitive, but it only seems to take a little while to learn the foundations of it.
