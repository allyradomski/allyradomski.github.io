I started researching for my essay (a separate project!) with resources that my supervisor Craig Wells provided. A big resource I have heavily enjoyed reading and exploring is Francisco López’s essays.

<ul>
<li>
    <b> Sonic Creatures </b>
    <br><br>
    Very interesting essay about abstracting sound away from the “source” and putting it on the same ontological “reality level” as the being it came from. This can be related to being present and connected with the world. The essay argues this is to see sound as more it's own thing, but not a way to isolate it in a void.

    <b> Against the Stage </b>
    <br><br>
    An exploration of the separation of the visually technical and the sound, especially for electronic music. Think about why we feel the need for visual elements in sound performance.
</li>
<br>

    <b> Environmental Sound Matter </b>
    <br><br>
    Discusses the capturing of the “sound matter” of a place as its own individual entity, without abstracting different components (often animal sounds) over a backdrop of the other sounds. Instead hearing it for what it is as it’s own whole. Also discusses that it is never an attempt to capture “reality” as that is not possible given differing microphones and editing and the temporal decision of being there.

</ul>

My essay subject inspires me creatively, the reason I chose what I chose. Inevitably, ideas I explore there will impact my studio project, and vice versa. 

### Granulator Experiment
I wanted to experiment with sound more thoughtfully with the things I learnt. I did a little Ableton experiment by using an old recording I made whilst in the Lake District and used a granulator on it with a midi controller with CC knobs, then cutting the “performance” up and abstracting the parts I liked. I made a short audio file, just an experiment.

### 25:31:12 hours in my bedroom
I haven’t the energy to go out and I often find myself stuck in my bedroom, which ultimately isn’t a place I feel completely at home in. I decided to record the audio over a span of 24 hours, inspired by the “Environmental Sound Matter” essay by López. I wanted to hear what a “floating ear” above my bed headboard would hear. Complete with snoring, singing, creaky door hinges, cars outside my window. I had struggled with acting “normal” while being observed by this microphone, which I dont think is possible unless I set it up and then somehow completely forget it, not that it entirely matters!

I used Granulator III to automatically capture a segment of the long recording. It randomly granulates different parts of the audio at different rates. There is a lot of "noise", but I think that's just the outcome of using this microphone to record quiet noises. The noise could also have been contributed too by short envelope on Granulator which may have caused clipping.

### 32:65 minutes of a spot in Pollock park
On a need for air and time to think, I walked to a spot in Pollock park where the rays were shining through the trees. I wanted to capture the sound matter of the location whilst I was writing and thinking. At first, I felt the pressure of being observed, but yet again, it doesn't matter too much.

I used the same process as previous experiment. The same noise/click is at the start of each time it changes. I think maybe the way I am doing it is too much for the system. I could experiment in VCV Rack as I know that is more lightweight, possibly even PureData. I could also split a file up into many smaller files and have it sort of play them randomly like on a Drum Rack. I'm not sure.

## Thoughts

I am eager to explore sound more and I look forward to how my essay will impact the way I hear sound. The last experiment I did was with DMX Lighting, and after reading Against the Stage, I feel that yes, sound needs its space and consideration if it is to be thoughtfully experienced. DMX Lighting could aid in the environment, but I am eager to explore sound as a main substance.
