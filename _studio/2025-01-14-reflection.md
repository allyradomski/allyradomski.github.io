2025, to get cracking, I want to first consider what I actually want to make.
The main points I want to follow are:

<div class="" style="padding: 0px 0px 10px; filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 7px green); background-color: white;">
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li> + Create a "living" digitally-powered creature.</li>
    <li> + An environment that surrounds.</li>
    <li> + Have it react to human presence, even negatively.</li>
    <li> + Sound experience at the forefront.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
Having thought about this studio project throughout my exploration on the ontology of sound in my DH&T essay, I do want to take things I have learnt writing the essay and apply them to my studio work. 

There are different ways to create the parts that'll make up the sound experience.I could decypher particular properties from experiences, such as the movement of a sound above me, I can then apply this movement to a different sound. I also want the sounds not to be of any particular "perfect nature" sort of interest. I want to capture sonic matter of the seemingly mundane, boring or brief and turn and use what I capture to turn it into a sonic experience that contributes to creature environment. Maybe it won't inherit typical characteristics of life such as breathing, footsteps, etc, but be a creature in an environment sense. You could consider a random road somewhere a living creature.
