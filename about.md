Hi, my name is Ally Radomski and I'm an aspiring new media artist based in the UK. I'm studying [Interaction Design](https://www.gsa.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-degrees/interaction-design/) at The Glasgow School of Art. Pursuing art is a new found interest for me, I properly started creating art at the start of 2021 using [Processing](https://processing.org) after realising Computer Science wasn't the course for me, I want to create pretty things! I am also interested in creating audio pieces, hoping to explore modular synthesis more in the coming years. 

My aim is to create encaptivating installations and experiences that explore the boundaries of what art is.
