<!--Hi, my name is Ally Radomski and I'm an aspiring new media artist based in the UK. I'm studying [Interaction Design](https://www.gsa.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-degrees/interaction-design/) at The Glasgow School of Art. Pursuing art is a new found interest for me, I properly started creating art at the start of 2021 using [Processing](https://processing.org) after realising Computer Science wasn't the course for me, I want to create pretty things! I am also interested in creating audio pieces, hoping to explore modular synthesis more in the coming years.

My aim is to create encaptivating installations and experiences that explore the boundaries of what art is.-->

I am a creator based in Glasgow. Blending digital and other traditional mediums is what I enjoy the most. I have a background in computer science and I wanted to bring out the creativity in the discipline. I find great satisfaction in the act of creation. There's nothing quite like seeing all the different elements come together to bring an idea into existence. It's a truly exhilarating experience, an unparalleled rush.

I am currently studying Interaction Design at The Glasgow School of Art.
