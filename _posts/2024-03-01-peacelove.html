<hr>

I gathered writings and photographs, majority of which are from places where I felt entirely present and connected with the world.<br> 
I found beauty in being alone and realising I was not alone at all.<br>
<br>
<i>Peacelove</i> is a word I relate to this feeling. <i>Peacelove</i> connects me. <i>Peacelove</i> is a present feeling in these places.

The work is displayed on a CRT and consists of writings being etched on the screen and photos changing in the background. Generative sound accompanies with field recordings and etching noises.

The diplay is dressed in fabrics that remind me of home and patterns sewed onto the front piece. Rocks further decorate.
