The algorithm first generates a random set of points. It then connects them with my [delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) algorithm. 
After, I split the lines up into points and connected these points to other points from other lines depending on if it's below a random max distance. This effect was inspired by my friend Brennan's [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgCxnYFqHIT/).
Finally I draw these lines using either dots, or a simple line and add a droop using half a sine wave.

Here are some progress outputs of my tinkering.
