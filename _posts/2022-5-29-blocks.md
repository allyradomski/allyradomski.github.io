🟥 🟦 🟪 🟩 🟧 ⬛️ 🟫

'[Blocks](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/13780)' is a generative art project that has been published on [fx(hash)](https://www.fxhash.xyz/doc/fxhash/overview). The platform uses [Tezos](https://tezos.com/carbon/) which is an energy efficient blockchain.

Everytime someone purchases the artwork, they are given a random variation of it.

Each variation of ‘Blocks’ is different. The blocks are randomly placed which causes completely different loops of sounds with each mint. A random palette is selected along with different block shapes, sounds, borders, backgrounds and other random features. This has all been meticulously designed with the hope that all variations will be loved.
