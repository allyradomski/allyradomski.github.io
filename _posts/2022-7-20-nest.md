These have been minted on [objkt.com](https://objkt.com) under the collection [Nests](https://objkt.com/collection/KT1Sb3ZYtA1uzh7G6q216V5dffmBAmuPQyGx). 

The algorithm first generates the sides of hexagons. Similarly to [droop](https://allyradomski.art/artwork/droop), I split the lines up into points and connect these points to other points from other lines depending on if it's below a random max distance. This creates the droopiness on inside of the hexagons. Then the hexagon sides are drawn.

Then random lines are generated that can span the entire image and then do the same thing as before, connecting them. This creates the web. This is drawn on top of everything else.

Below it all, lots of random 'cells' are generated and placed randomly.
