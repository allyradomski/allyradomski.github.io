As part of this exhibition, my friend [Ellie Harrison](https://www.instagram.com/elliehar.t/) and me worked on the phones. People can read the telephone book provided to find numbers to call on the phones. When the numbers are called, a spoken audio recording of the written piece is spoken back through the telephone speaker. 

We created three phones in total, two of which were rotary and the other being push button. We used a few different libraries (linked below) and hardware such as Arduino Nanos and DFPlayers to make it work.

Immerse yourself in writing and recordings played through old telephones, where different voices touch on topics from politics to gender, loneliness to love. This installation invites you to write your own words to be shared with future visitors and will end with a publication of the collected works.
<br><br>
This interactive exhibition serves as a living archive of writingâ€”a dialogue where visitors are encouraged not just to listen but to respond. You can contribute your own writing and leave your own â€˜messagesâ€™. All the tools you need to start your own writing journey await you in the installation or join us for free writing sessions at GWL that we will host throughout the weeks. 
<br><br>
After a year of exploring creative writing, the Free Writing Society invites you to experience the peaceful and connecting space theyâ€™ve discovered through writing and sharing.
