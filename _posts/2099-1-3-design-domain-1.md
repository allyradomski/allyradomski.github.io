### Introduction

The theme for Design Domain this year is Materiality. I’ll interpret this in context to Interaction Design and will research and conceptualize ideas of what I want to achieve in this project.

### First thoughts

My first thoughts for Materiality was exploring what senses objects and materials invoke, such as touch, scent, sight and sound. Perhaps how sound gets muffled by walls or how it travels through water. Or maybe how soft a cushion is compared to a concrete floor. I need to be able to give the project an Interaction Design spin, somehow digitize it but also have it there in front of you, not just on a screen. For example, using a projector could give a real object a different surface using say, generative shaders. Or maybe I could create procedural audio for different objects which can be swapped out in front of a camera, to give a voice to the silent objects based on the overall feeling they give off. Materialising senses that otherwise don’t exist, using the material properties that come from an object? I could represent numerous different materials in Processing using different properties like their density, how brittle it is, and maybe it’s melting point.

I do like the idea of giving sound to silent objects depending on the properties of the material it’s made from. This could be achieved by using a camera and some sort of distinction in visuals to detect which object is currently there.

### Research

#### Kiki & Bouba

Giving a sound to something that doesn’t have sound is subjective. Not everyone is going to agree on what it would sound like if it made a sound.. but often people do feel the same way about it. I remember watching Tom Scott’s [video](https://youtu.be/1TDIAObsqcs) on the Bouba/kiki effect, in which people are given two shapes and two names, and they match the name to the shape.
