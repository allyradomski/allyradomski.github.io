### Introduction

For this project we are using Unity which is a popular game engine that can also be used for more than just games! It provides a diverse palette to create basically whatever you want. In this project, the task is to create a **dynamic environment** in which the user can interact with it using both realtime visuals and dynamic audio.

### Research

I had the idea to use procedural audio for the environment, this can be done by using Open Sound Control (OSC). This allows me to connect applications and use realtime sound to control things in other applications, and also to control sound from another application. I am going to use VCV Rack 2 for this since it is free. VCV Rack 2 is a software modular synthesizer that lets us use a bunch of sound modules for free to create music, such as procedural ambient music.

For the visual side of it, I want it to feel like a location that is soothing but also uncanny. I thought about how I could create this in a few weeks, and decided to go for a low poly retro look.

I created this mindmap whilst researching for the project.

A while back I purchased Fatum Betula on Switch and enjoyed every part of it. It uses a retro-lowpoly-lowres style, similar to the original Doom game. Whilst I played this game, it felt eerily empty, strange.. surreal. It heavily reminded me of those liminal space photos that circulated mid 2010s. These are oddily familiar yet uncanny places, something you'd see in a weird dream.

* Fig 1.1 - This location is of a traditional Japanese (?) house surrounded by water, with a cherry blossom tree next to it. This place just feels odd and wrong but it's very intriquing. It's soothing but feels like I am being watched.

* Fig 1.2 - This one is of a church in autumn surrounded by trees. It makes me question "why is it here?", "who built it?", "why is it so isolated?".

* Fig 1.3 - This is during the start of the game in a corridor with water flowing down the walls. An unsettling godly creature appears that asks you to water an ethereal tree that has roots in limbo. 
A more in-depth look into how the textures work, as shown in *Fig 1.31* below, shows that it's comprised of repeating scrolling water texture and caustics on top of wall texture.

***Fig 2*** -
I've also played a game called Stars Die which is familiar to Fatum Betula in the style and the overall feelings throughout the game. It's about an island covered in fleshy growth that scientists are researching.

* Fig 2.1 - The atmosphere in this photo is very otherworldly and alien. A blood red moon, pink sky, purple water, strange rock colours and plant colours. It is a lot of red and purple. We rarely naturally see our planet this colour in real life. 

* Fig 2.2 - This is another view of the island. This time with some sort of gas emanating from the rock and lots of strange fleshy foliage.

***Fig 3*** - 
I keep coming back to Zdzisław Beksiński's work and would enjoy doing a deep dive into it sometime. His work is called dystopian surrealism. His paintings often depict a bleak desolate future, mixing architecture with gruesome organic looking materials and illogical scenary.

* Fig 3.1 - A peculiar tree branching on one axis seemingly alone on a strange plain. It's hard to find words for it, it just feels like nothing ever seen before in person. The tree feels divine, something of importance, beauty maybe we don't understand. 

* Fig 3.2 - A cathedral either made or covered in a strange organic structure of strands. It heavily reminds of me a close up shot of the iris (Fig 3.21) by [Suren Manvelyan](https://www.surenmanvelyan.com/eyes/your-beautiful-eyes/?occur=1&cover=0&album=5). The feelings this invokes is emptyness, a relic of a time far gone.

***Fig 4*** -
Similarly to the work of Zdzisław and Eric (Stars Die), The War Of The Worlds features something called the red weed. This red weed spreads across the earth, blanketing previously lush countryside with a red fleshy organic structure.

* Fig 4.1 - This is one interpretation of the red weed. This is a cover from Jeff Wayne's musical version of the story by H.G. Wells. Personally, I don't like this interpretation. It is too light and almost looks like lava or fire.

* Fig 4.2 - This image is from the cover of the album by Jeff Wayne. I particularly like the song "Horsell Common and the Heat Ray" from the album. One instrument that stands out to me is the Tar.
