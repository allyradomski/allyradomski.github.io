# Introduction

## Brief

The idea for Open Share is to revisit an older project and prepare it for an exhibition space. We only have 4 days to do this, so cannot think too ambitious. 

## Ideas

I'm going to briefly explore and figure out which project I want to revisit.
### Projects
* #### Realtime Events
I created a short linear retro PS1 inspired experience in Unity.
* #### Data Visualisation
I visualized satellites around Earth creating a voyager golden record inspired poster.
* #### Typographic Narratives
I explored different ways in which text can be used digitally. I created Processing sketches and After Effects projects.
* #### Control
I created a Processing sketch showing random planets that could be controlled with Arduino.
* #### Design Domain
I created a platform which objects could be placed on and different sounds would be played. Used Arduino, Processing controlling VCV Rack 2 with OSC.
* #### Extended Reality (XR)
I created a zine full of personal poetry which could be experienced through AR to extend it.

### Discussion
I want to be proud of the work I'm going to exhibit, especially since people will see it. 
Though I can think of some problems for exhibiting:
* Projects that require my laptop, such as projects using Processing.
  * Possible options in studio like M1 Mac Minis.
* Anything with sound, probably will require headphones.
  * I'm not a huge fan of exhibitions that require headphones. 
  * There could be quiet sounds out loud.
* Space, Years 1, 2 and 3 will be occupying the space (Barnes' Garage). Anything requiring space like projection mapping may be difficult. I do not have much idea of anything Years 1 & 3 are doing. 
  * Difficult to exactly know as such a short time to complete this.

Extended Reality I feel is my best project yet in terms of personal worth. I'm not sure if it plays a part that it's fresh in my mind, but I feel it could be interesting to have my zine on a table with a tablet and ambient sounds around. Maybe a monitor with visuals. For visuals I may need a BrightSign from Media Studio. A monitor that plays from USB would also do.
