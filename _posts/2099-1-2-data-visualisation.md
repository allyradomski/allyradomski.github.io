### Introduction

The aim of this project is to create a static image in Processing to visualize some downloaded data. This data will be in the form of a csv and be accessed locally. The image needs to convey what the data is telling us.

### Research

The first step in this project is figuring out what data to use. I want the data to have lots of columns so there's plenty to experiment on. I also need to be interested in the data. I am thinking about what is personal to me. Some ideas are:

* Data on transgender people
* Data on mental health

I tried to find data on transgender stats (population, openness, quality-of-life..) but there hasn't been much research I can find in which I can download data. The data I have found is rather small so wouldn't be good for creating a data-driven piece.

I also felt that maybe isn't the best idea to work with mental health as that would be quite depressing.

#### Satellites

I've decided to go with satellite data as it sounds quite exciting to work on! I got the CSV data from Celestrak [here](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=active&FORMAT=csv).

I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gAYqtmNJx8) video by NSSI to learn about the key orbital elements.

I used numerous resources, mainly wikipedia, to get the formulas to get values such as Semi-major axis, which is needed for visualizing the orbit.
