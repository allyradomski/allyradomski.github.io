### Introduction

The aim of this project is to create a static image in Processing to visualize some downloaded data. This data will be in the form of a csv and be accessed locally. The image needs to convey what the data is telling us.

### Research

The first step in this project is figuring out what data to use. I want the data to be more than two dimensions so that there will be much more to play around with in visualizing it. I also need to be interested in the data. I am thinking about what is personal to me. Some ideas are:

* Data on transgender people
* Data on mental health
* Data on zelda games
