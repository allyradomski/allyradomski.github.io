**Inside** is a short zine of poetry written as a way to express difficult emotions. I compiled 5 different poems and created small digital scenes for each one. 
<div style="padding:45% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/821746331?h=00c46a06db&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

I don't want to go too deep to what it all means to me as I don't want to warp any meaning it has to you.

## A Blanket of Discomfort (Page 1)

>A heavy aura of discomfort blankets my being.
>
>It's all encompassing, unescapable. Will it ever lighten?
>
>Time feels still, that the chime will never be sung. But it does, yet the pain isn't done.
>
>My mind is a prison, I am shackled to the walls.
>
>Promises from an open door, but I only get visitors from ashore. 

## Repetition (Page 2)

>Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter

>Spring, I wonder what's next.

## Ghost (Page 3)

>Left, up the stairs, and to the right.
>
>That's where you hide.
>
>You sit there on your bed. I can't see your face.
>
>Did you die?
>
>Please speak to me, please speak to me, please..
>
>What happened?
>
>I don't understand.
>
>Was your warm love,
>
>Your gentle touch,
>
>The glint in your eyes,
>
>And the happiness we had..
>
>Was it all a lie?

## Full Emptiness (Page 4)

>Spread out, limbs contorted, she lay on the floor.
>
>It was stable and knew its purpose. She needed that.
>
>Her eyes looked up, not at the ceiling, but beyond.
>
>A gaze upon a full emptiness. Too familiar a space.
>
>Seeing nothing, but feeling everything: she sought clarity.
>
>She never found it. She isn't sure she ever will.

## Insatiable Bliss (Page 5 & 6)

>When you're around, my doubts runaway.
>
>Your company: the definition of bliss. Everything is fine.
>
>We hug goodbye with a duration I can never accept.
>
>I am alone now, the pleasure fades into the unrecollectable abyss.
>
>Your presence feels infinitely short and your absence infinitely long. 
>
>Merely a parasite, I long for you to come back.
