I looked at a leaf one day, and was like, yeah, I could probably make that. Idk why.

The art can be copy and pasted anywhere as text.
Hopefully works with your browser ðŸ¤ž 

<iframe id="iframe" src="https://allyradomski.art/p5js/plants/" title="plants">
</iframe>

<script id="plant_script">
    const iframe = document.getElementById("iframe");
    const article = document.getElementById("plant_script").parentNode;
    function newseed() {
        iframe.src = "https://allyradomski.art/p5js/plants/";
    }
    function resize() {
        iframe.style.width = (article.clientWidth - 2) + "px";
        iframe.style.height = ((article.clientWidth - 2) * 0.5625) + "px";
    }
    resize();
    window.onresize = resize;
</script>

<button id="new" onclick="newseed()">New seed</button>

Alternatively [open](https://allyradomski.art/p5js/plants/) the link on it's own page.
