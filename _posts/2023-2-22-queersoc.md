"[To Make Things Perfectly Queer](https://www.instagram.com/p/Co48PZRqbLO/)" was an exhibition of queer artists from The Glasgow School of Art's Queersoc (LGBTQIA+ society). It was shown in Project Space 1 & 2 in the top floor of the Vic Café & Bar. 

In this exhibition I projected a collection of some of my favourite artworks on a wall, looping throughout the exhibition. I also showed three physical artworks.
