# Overview

Combine a physical control device built with an Arduino, and a Processing sketch to transform input from the control device to an output. Explore the relationship between the device and the output and how it works together. Explore what control means.

## Submission Details

* Video (2 minutes maximum) and photographic documentation of the final artefact. Make sure to take high quality imagery and consider the lighting and environment.

* Annotated code for the Arduino and Processing sketches. Reference any resources used online by commenting a link beside relavant code.

* A single Instagram ready JPEG image (1080 x 1350px)

# Research

## Initial ideas

During the Control launch, I wrote some notes and relevant ideas as they popped into my head. Below are the notes, forewarning, they were written quickly and without too much thought.

* modular synthesisers
* small LED screens
* light
* utilise multiple senses
* ponder meaning of control, or even lack of control
* materials that could be used
* exploration of different arduino control components
* make the control feel satisfying and clear
* keep it all "in a box" with focus on just the control and outputs
* haptic feedback
* output that is surrounding and 'real'
* use sound 101%
* explore interactive installations
* don't constrain, or make apparent constrain.
* non-descript controls, so that it can be figured out. 
* Utilisation of no type?, just image and sound?
* expression of the user (brendan dawes)
* explore existing interactable objects
* explore different housing

## Exploration of the ideas

### Modular synthesis

A few days prior to starting this project, I came across a project called [typeMachine by heike neff](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ck9DKjyrz13/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). This is already a good example of the utilisation of physical control with Arduino and Processing, but, the controls reminded me of what you'd see on modules from a modular synthesiser.
