# Overview

Combine a physical control device built with an Arduino, and a Processing sketch to transform input from the control device to an output. Explore the relationship between the device and the output and how it works together. Explore what control means.

## Submission Details

* Video (2 minutes maximum) and photographic documentation of the final artefact. Make sure to take high quality imagery and consider the lighting and environment.

* Annotated code for the Arduino and Processing sketches. Reference any resources used online by commenting a link beside relavant code.

* A single Instagram ready JPEG image (1080 x 1350px)

# Research

## Initial ideas

During the Control launch, I wrote some notes and relevant ideas as they popped into my head. Below are the notes, forewarning, they were written quickly and without too much thought.

* modular synthesisers
* small LED screens
* light
* utilise multiple senses
* ponder meaning of control, or even lack of control
* materials that could be used
* exploration of different arduino control components
* make the control feel satisfying and clear
* keep it all "in a box" with focus on just the control and outputs
* haptic feedback
* output that is surrounding and 'real'
* use sound 101%
* explore interactive installations
* don't constrain, or make apparent constrain.
* non-descript controls, so that it can be figured out. 
* Utilisation of no type?, just image and sound?
* expression of the user (brendan dawes)
* explore existing interactable objects
* explore different housing

## Exploration of the ideas

### Synthesizers

A few days prior to starting this project, I came across a project called [typeMachine by heike neff](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ck9DKjyrz13/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). This is already a good example of the utilisation of physical control with Arduino and Processing. But also, the controls reminded me of what you'd see on modules from a modular synthesizer and other synthesizers.

I picked the synthesizers above because of each of them is unique and interesting. The **Marbles** module is clean and intuitive. The clear labels under the controls and the bold attractive colours I can imagine would make it fun to use, it reminds me of what it felt like to play around as a child. Similarly, the **DUO** is very friendly and looks like a small childs toy. As the name implies, it's designed to be used by two people at once. There are no sharp edges, everything is rounded, and that makes it less intimidating.

Inversely, the **Mescaline V.2** looks mad and alien. It's busy, it's dark, it has organic qualities to it like the hexagonal nest-like decals, but also geometrically complex curves, lines and layout. It's what I imagine would be found on an extraterrestrial bioship designed to navigate the bizzare otherwordly ship. Similarly, the **Quanrantid Swarm** also looks unfamiliar, but it is more clearer to understand what is happening. The colours, orange and black, lead into the *Swarm* aspect of the name, like a wasp swarm. The radial circles expanding like an echo with lines stretching out gives off an impression of a large hive mind.

This research into different synthesizers makes it apparent that the design of the controller links closely to the output. A fun inviting machine that encourages childlike behaviour I'd expect to produce bouncy soft output. An intimdating complex unfamiliar looking machine I'd expect harsh sharp and unpleasant sounds. **It's crucial to consider the feelings you want to induce, to build the controller and output in tandem.**

### Components achievable

I'll be using the Arduino Uno for the project. The Uno has 6 analog inputs, and 12 usable digital input and outputs (some of which can emulate analog output). It is possible to connect more inputs and outputs, but since this project is only 4 weeks long, I'll limit myself to stock Uno inputs and outputs.

There are numerous components already in the studio that can be accessed. This includes potentiometers, ultrasonic sensors, buttons, small LEDs and small screen displays. If I need a lot of one component or need something they don't have, I can order it in. I am going to explore (Pimoroni)[https://shop.pimoroni.com/] and (The PiHut)[https://thepihut.com] for inexpensive components and see what sparks my interest.

After pondering what I could use while exploring for components, I think I realized I want to create the controller to be a device without text and without much instruction. I want it to be playful and fun to use with satisfying buttons to press, and for the user to explore what each thing does. I think letting someone figure out how something works is important. The above components I picked out I thought would be satisfying to use. The hexagonal LED display could be used to display your interactions with the controller. Perhaps it could fill up when moving a slider upwards.
