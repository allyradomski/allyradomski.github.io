This website was created using Jekyll and Github Pages. Jekyll is a static site generator that has integration into Github Pages, which allows me to host this website entirely free (except for the domain name)!

I have iterated on the design on this site again and again and tailored it to suit me. I have learnt a lot about web development from doing this.
