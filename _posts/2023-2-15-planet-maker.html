This was apart of my project "Control" in the first year I was studying Interaction Design. You can read my journal entry <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/journal/control">here</a>.<br>
<br>
I created this "Planet Maker" with Processing linked to VCV Rack and Arduino. I created my own classes to generate the planet geometry and "terrain maps" that can be manipulated with physical knobs. Processing sends OSC messages to VCV Rack to tell it to do "alien speech", "charge up sounds" and general ambient noise. I also created the outline shader by simple checking neighbouring pixels to find edges.<br><br>

I really enjoyed making the systems from scratch. <br><br>

Unfortunately I cannot find screen-capture footage with sound.
