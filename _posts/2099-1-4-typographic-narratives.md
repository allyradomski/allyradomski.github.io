### Introduction

Typography is the art of arranging type. Type is either a physical block with a character etched into it, or the way characters are represented in digital form.

The aim of this project is to create typographic art with an interaction design twist, not just using standard methods.

I have played around with manipulating character glyphes in p5.js before using opentype.js so I am a little familiar, but I am excited to delve into this.

### Processing

I used Geomerative in Processing to create a few different outputs. It took a while to get a grasp of Geomerative, but eventually I learnt how to split a string of font glyphs into an array of points that I could manipulate. I used the method getCurveLength and getPoint with the RCommand object to able to have futher detail in the outline. 

Initially I chose the word "FUCKKKK" because it was one of the first that popped into my head. I felt I could somehow represent this exclamation of fustration or anger with Processing by making it morph and stretch and repeat in a weird glitchy seeming manner.

I changed it to "FUUUCK" as that's how you'd say it if extending it. Below is an experiment with it being red.

Below is the final animated version.

### After Effects

After the tutorial with Gillian, I felt I had a small grasp of the software and wanted to explore it more. Using the song Foot Chamber by Soap&Skin, I attempted to visualize this song using typography and video.

The video was taken in slow-motion on a train whilst on a trip. I really liked the scenery and the parallax of all the layers of the view. I wanted to include the town as I felt it fit into the song, it felt quite remote, but in a gorgeous place. I feel the song is sad but pretty.

Soap&Skin made some music for the Netflix series Dark, in which the intro has lots of mirrored imagery. I explored the way in which I could mirror my video, and also not make it feel too stale.

Below is the final video. Due to compression and the grain, it doesn't look exactly like my original.
