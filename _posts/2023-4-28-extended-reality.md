# Introduction

The brief for this project is to use Unity to achieve **AR** or **VR**. 
* AR (Augmented Reality) augments our reality with digital visuals. 
* VR (Virtual Reality) is a digital simulated reality experienced by a user, it replaces our reality. 
* XR (Extended Reality) emcompasses these both.

# Ideas 

Since Realtime Events went well for me, I am confident with this project and want to push myself. 

In my previous projects, I feel I haven't expressed myself in them, that it's lacking a part of me and has really no personal meaning. I want to express myself in this project. Of course art doesn't need deep meaning, but I want it to have meaning to me at least, with the ability for others to interpret however they want to.

After talking to people about **creative writing** and wanting to start dabbling in it for a while, I think that no time is better than now for this project. I want to use writing to **express myself** in a creative and artistic way, to put others into a space that expresses part of my reality. One worry I do have about this project is not wanting to come across as pretentious or to forcefully have deep meaning.

## Idea 1
Since the only affordable and viable way of doing AR is using a handheld device to look through, I have been having doubts about doing that as I don't feel that is immersive. But on the other hand, VR feels too encasing and moving yourself completely away from reality. **I want to mix the realities.**

My thought is to be able to view part of the reality we live in within VR. My idea is to put the VR headset on, but a camera will stream feed into Unity so that you can see the world in the headset, but then to augment that further.

## Idea 2

Expressing myself could be done exploring various things.

* Gender dysphoria
* OCD & Anxiety
* Depression
* Lonelyness
* Numbness
* Lack of direction

All these are quite negative, but I often long for a way to express myself and don't know how. Struggling to even understand myself sometimes.

I am my thoughts, so writing could appear throughout showing these thoughts in a rather unclear and abstract way so maybe they could relate to them. Maybe the user could interact with these by looking at them, which could then influence the scene.
