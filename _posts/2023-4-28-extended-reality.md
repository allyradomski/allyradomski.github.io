# Introduction

The brief for this project is to use Unity to achieve **AR** or **VR**. 
* AR (Augmented Reality) augments our reality with digital visuals. 
* VR (Virtual Reality) is a digital simulated reality experienced by a user, it replaces our reality. 
* XR (Extended Reality) emcompasses these both.

# Ideas 

Since Realtime Events went well for me, I am confident with this project and want to push myself. 

In my previous projects, I feel I haven't expressed myself in them, that it's lacking a part of me and has really no personal meaning. I want to express myself in this project. Of course art doesn't need deep meaning, but I want it to have meaning to me at least, with the ability for others to interpret however they want to.

After talking to people about **creative writing** and wanting to start dabbling in it for a while, I think that no time is better than now for this project. I want to use writing to **express myself** in a creative and artistic way, to put others into a space that expresses part of my reality. One worry I do have about this project is not wanting to come across as pretentious or to forcefully have deep meaning.

Expressing myself could be done exploring various things.

* Gender dysphoria
* OCD & Anxiety
* Depression
* Lonelyness
* Numbness
* Lack of direction

All these are quite negative, but I often long for a way to express myself and don't know how. Struggling to even understand myself sometimes.

Something else to note is to make it so it isn't a linear experience. People should be able to hop in and out at any time and still experience what I want them to.

## Idea 1 - Mixing realities
Since the only affordable and viable way of doing AR is using a handheld device to look through, I have been having doubts about doing that as I don't feel that it's that immersive. I thought maybe realities could be mixed.

My thought is to be able to view part of the reality we live in within VR. My idea is to put the VR headset on, but a camera will stream feed into Unity so that you can see the world in the headset, but then to augment that further.

I am my thoughts, so writing could appear throughout showing these thoughts in a rather unclear and abstract way so maybe they could relate to them. Maybe the user could interact with these by looking at them, which could then influence the scene.

Here's a little mockup of my idea. Only problem with this concept is the requirement of an external camera.

## Idea 2

I've been intrigued with liminal spaces recently having watched:

* [Liminal Spaces (Exploring an Altered Reality)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N63pQGhvK4M) - Solar Sands
* [Found Footage (nothing happens)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBheepejVTs) - Lazy Posy
* [Liminal Spaces and Your Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKe_iiaK5JE) - Captain KRB

Thinking back on dreams I've had do remind me of liminal spaces. A space between reality and sleep.

## Idea 3

Having talked to my friend about making zines, it made me realize that I could make my own zine and use AR to bring it to life. The zine could stand on it's own, but the addition of AR could give it lots more character.

## Tutorial

In the tutorial I discussed ideas with Neil and ultimately I decided on doing AR. We discussed the idea of creating a portal that can take the user between reality and virtual reality. I started work on this.

### Prototype

By watching a [tutorial on stencil buffers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM8LGzMjmc) and using depth masks, I managed to create a semi working portal effect.
