        <p>I am a creator based in Glasgow. Blending digital and other traditional media is what I enjoy the most. I have a background in computer science and I wanted to bring out the creativity in the discipline. I find great satisfaction in the act of creation. There's nothing quite like seeing all the different elements come together to bring an idea into existence.</p>
