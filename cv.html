I am a highly motivated individual with a strong interest in technology and design and I strive to push myself in all the work that I do. I am currently in my third year studying for an art bachelor’s degree in Interaction Design at the Glasgow School of Art. I find joy in teamwork and supporting others to achieve their full potential. I am self-assured and want to work hard to learn new skills that will improve me in all areas.
