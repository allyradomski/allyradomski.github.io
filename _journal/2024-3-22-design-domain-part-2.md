# Introduction

This is Part 2 of Design Domain, Part 1 is [here](https://allyradomski.art/journal/design-domain-part-1).

In Part 1, I explored ideas of emergence and considered other processes.

# Experiments

I have tried more experiments in Processing, I tried to wrap cellular automata in a circle and use rules from that to determine where the thread goes. 
[Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)

I couldn't get this to work effectively, and maybe it isn't quite as possible to show anything unless it's over time or more pegs.

# Thoughts

I've been thinking about finding emergence in string art using my limited amount of pegs.
I've been looking at other emergence closer and noticing some things.

- Continuous space
    * Birds flock in space that isn't limited to a grid or discrete points, they act in a continuous 3d space.
- Visual changes
    * Conway's Game of Life shows emergence through steps through time.
    * A cellular automata also shows emergence through steps, but through change on an axis.
- Brain
    * I suppose all life is emergent, it evolved over millions of years, us being multicellular organisms where small parts make up a complex system. I'd also like to explore this more.

## My thread idea

I tried to show emergence through behaviour in people, letting them contribute with the thread however they wanted to. Using the thread to show emergent behaviour.

Another idea which is maybe seperate from emergence is following a simple steps of instructions to an outcome, like instruction based art.

I still want to use thread but I may have to move on the idea from pegs in a circle. I don't want to make a process that produces a spirograph.

# Experiments
I'm going to do some small experiments to see if I get any ideas or inspiration for what to do with the thread. 

## Rice
An idea I had was using the seemingly randomness of the world to generate an artwork.

* Grab a few fingers full of rice grains and drop on a surface.
* Shake the surface
* For each grain, draw a line in the direction of the rice.
    * End the lines if they reach another line.

I tried this process on paper, quite tedious, but it does produce the same effect. The possibly only difference is choosing which rice line to draw as a human isn't random. I found I draw the lines from bottom to top, and typically going to the nearest next point.

## Experiments making agent (attempted) emergent system

First I drew out an idea of what I wanted. My idea was for each agent to have a sensitivity value and a fixed proneness value. When close to other agents for too long it'd become too sensitive and want to move away from everyone else.

<div class="row">
<figure class="figure col-6">

    <img src="{{ page.assetdir }}/code.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Programming the system">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Programming the system</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

I gave each agent different properties:
* Proneness (Random) - How much the sensitivity increases
* Sensitivity - How far from others it wants to remain
* Speed (Random) - A random speed
* x, y - Position

When running they clumped into circles and seemed to remain stable.

I don't think I'll explore this further as it didn't ignite any ideas relating to thread.

## Conclusion from experiments
I don't want to produce something to be viewed through a screen, since Part 1 I've wanted something physical. I do like the output from the rice idea, but I don't think I can expand this any meaningful way to me. I also am set on using thread.

## Final idea

I quite like the idea of doing instruction based art mixed with mental processes. [MoMA fluxus](https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/407#:~:text=Fluxus%20artists%20often%20used%20language,and%20materials%20of%20the%20everyday.). A few of my past projects have been related to writing and emotion. I have thread to use, there's lots of ways it can be used. Maybe for hanging or wrapping or weaving. 

I could have instructions like:

- Write instructions below
    * Get thread
    * Do something with thread
    * Feel

### Following this idea

I got black and white thread, two rocks from my windowsil, and wrapped them. I set myself a time, an hour to do a big rock and 30 minutes to do a small rock.

I then felt. I felt both satisfied and exhausted. Satisfied this could be an idea meaningful and exhausted that my hands had been moving lots and that I have had withering passion for this project. But I am passionate about this idea now. It's quite irregular from my other projects but it could be nice.
