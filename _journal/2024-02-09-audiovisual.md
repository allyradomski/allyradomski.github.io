# Research
## Paul Klee
My friend recommended to look into Paul Klee after we discussed sound notation in writing. He is known for his expressionism paintings. From wikipedia: “(Expressionism) typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas.”

I find warmth and peace in this artwork. There’s a lot of shapes with flow and curves that deform and stretch or pull.

## Max Cooper collaborations

An electronic artist called Max Cooper often commissions audiovisual videos for his music pieces.

    I really like this video, entirely monochrome and harsh visuals but does put me in a sort of trance.

## Ryoji Ikeda

Ryoji Ikeda does sound work that is represented with very digital looking art. His works often installed in giant spaces using mainly monochromatic colours, strobing, and electronic sounds.

I am a fan of their album Dataplex. The album is comprised of very harsh electronic sounds that has occasional rhythms in some parts. It is harsh to listen to at first but I realized it could soothe me and help me be productive.

Test pattern is displayed in such a huge huge space, transporting anyone that goes in to an alien world seperate entirely from the world outside.

I remember seeing s.asmbli on Instagram and being infatuated. It's a projection on 5 inner walls of different environments (I think maybe point clouds??) that are appear and move, paired with sounds that perfectly match the visuals. The environments are almost being etched into reality at some points.

Looking further at their work I discovered node 5:5, also using this "etching" sort of thing with lasers and incredible sounds.

# Idea forming

## Brief ideas that appeared

* Experiencing ambient sound from around where sit with effects to enhance.
* Moving electronics (like printer heads) with Arduino using the sound from around.
* Visualise recorded audio from outdoors with words and colour to convey my experiences.
* A sound piece to show journey of being trans. From euphoria to dysphoria to growing as a person.
    * I want to exhibit something at the GSASA's Iridescence event which raises money for trans healthcare needs. I would like my project to be personal in some sense.

## Developing idea

Ryoichi Kurokawa's s.asmbli has inspired me lots to experiment similarly. I like the way the audio sounds like the work is being etched into the world with the sharp industrial tones. I’d like to do something similar for etching words onto a screen.

I experimented with type in the Typography project, Extended Reality project and also just personally. I want to explore this further. 

Over the past few months I have started writing more to capture ideas I want, I find it a great way to capture emotions and transport yourself back to times when you felt especially present. I have also been taking photos a digital camera from the early 2000s for a while and would like to explore how to use these.
