# Introduction

## Brief

The idea for Open Share is to revisit an older project and prepare it for an exhibition space. We only have 4 days to do this, so cannot think too ambitious. 

## Ideas

I'm going to briefly explore and figure out which project I want to revisit.
### Projects
* #### Realtime Events
I created a short linear retro PS1 inspired experience in Unity.
* #### Data Visualisation
I visualized satellites around Earth creating a voyager golden record inspired poster.
* #### Typographic Narratives
I explored different ways in which text can be used digitally. I created Processing sketches and After Effects projects.
* #### Control
I created a Processing sketch showing random planets that could be controlled with Arduino.
* #### Design Domain
I created a platform which objects could be placed on and different sounds would be played. Used Arduino, Processing controlling VCV Rack 2 with OSC.
* #### Extended Reality (XR)
I created a zine full of personal poetry which could be experienced through AR to extend it.

### Discussion
I want to be proud of the work I'm going to exhibit, especially since people will see it. 
Though I can think of some problems for exhibiting:
* Projects that require my laptop, such as projects using Processing.
  * Possible options in studio like M1 Mac Minis.
* Anything with sound, probably will require headphones.
  * I'm not a huge fan of exhibitions that require headphones. 
  * There could be quiet sounds out loud.
* Space, Years 1, 2 and 3 will be occupying the space (Barnes' Garage). Anything requiring space like projection mapping may be difficult. I do not have much idea of anything Years 1 & 3 are doing. 
  * Difficult to exactly know as such a short time to complete this.

Exploring these points in my mind, I decided to do Extended Reality. I'm not sure if it plays a part that it's fresh in my mind, but I feel it could be interesting to have my zine on a table with a tablet and ambient sounds around. Maybe a monitor with visuals. For visuals I may need a BrightSign from Media Studio. A monitor that plays from USB would also do. 

## Exploration Conclusion

Given we only have 3 days to do this, I decided to go with the AR zine as it stands alone with just the tablet. It is also my proudest work of the year and I feel comfortable exhibiting it. I'm going to have a plynth with the zine and the tablet, and maybe explore audio if there's enough time.

# Setup

## Scouting the spot

For AR I knew I wanted a manoeuvrable spot for people to move the tablet around on the zine, so I chose a spot on the inside of the room. I also wanted a bright spot for the AR to work effectively, so I made sure the spot was in good sight of the sunlight through the window.

## Top of plynth

The plynth I selected from the studio had 4 holes in the top for cables. I'm not using any cables, and it kind of ruins it. After pondering ideas like paper, or cutting and painting a wood panel, the ikea tables in the storage cupboard caught my eye. 

The top of the table looked perfect. It fitted well with the plynth with a bit of overhang and the legs simply came off.

## Patching up the dirt on the plynth

I used white paint to paint over the dirt on the plynth to try make it consistent white. This was with help from my peers who also needed to paint their walls for their pieces.

## Attaching the top

This was difficult to align in the center, and took a few attempts, but I am happy.

## Cover for the top

I brought down my zine to get a feel for what it would be like on the plynth. I didn't quite realise how off white the top actually was. I knew I couldn't just put it on top without anything else and I didn't really want to as that's boring. 

I thought it'd be nice to use the grid paper I used to draw the textures for the Unity scene within the zine. I also found strips printed on acryillic from when I was messing around with scanimation. 

All of these are black and white and I thought I'd try see what it looks like on top and it looks perfect. Honestly surprised how quickly it is coming along.

# Conclusion

## Information card for the exhibition

I need to write an information card which will be displayed on the plynth. I have been trying to figure out words for a while, trying not to make it sound pretentious or too personal, as I want people to take their own things away from it.

"Inside is a collection of poems written as an outlet for my emotions. It explores themes of uncertainty, confusion, loneliness, and hopelessness. The poems can be experienced using the tablet: allowing further expression of the poems through hand-drawn visuals curated into digital scenes. 

I hope that others will be able to find their own personal meaning in this zine, even though it is written from my own perspectives and emotions."
