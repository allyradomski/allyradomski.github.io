## Overview

* Pickpocket Eyes
  * Paul is working on this entirely so we don't need to worry about this project.
* Tickets
  * A large projected looping video sequence mapped on to hanging surfaces
  * Media player, After Effects/TouchDesigner, Non-interactive
  * Display of a range of different tickets from Glasgow Central, old to new. Possibly follow a route on a map like the Indiana Jones plane travel sequence, showing possible destinations from back then.
* Platform Objects
  * "A projection of typographical and animated treatment to spotlight and explain details about the object you choose to feature (eg. suitcases, Avery scales, etc.). We will generate a simple and elegant re-useable temple we can use on as many objects as you want to feature. This will involve projection mapping on to the platform and sequencing of media"
  * Projection, After Effects/TouchDesigner, Media player looping video, Non-interactive
* Ghost Objects
  * Simple Pepperâ€™s Ghost box presenting short looping animated 3D objects (eg. wireframe of train as proposed, or details of parts)
  * 3D software rendered sequences (Cinema 4D, Maya, Blender), Video media playback on loop, Non-interactive
* Ghost People
  * Projected actors in character, life-size, to be placed in 2/3 positions in the space as proposed
  * Actors probable to be both people that work there
  * Video media playback on controlled loop
  * ***Possibly*** *proximity-based interactive via Arduino PIR sensor input with live computer*
  * **Interested:** Kieron & Fedre (interested in making structure)
* Light Information
  * Simple Perspex sheets with laser-engraved text and edge lighter which act as captions and labels throughout the space.
  * Static internally-lit externally-powered artefacts, Non-interactive
  * Needs parts building like stand with wire through it and laser engraved perspex sheets.

We created WhatsApp group chats to communicate through each sub-project.
