## Task

### Overview

Create a video (a composite: made up of several parts) to tell a story about something that doesn't exist, something you've created. Use both artistic and technical skills.

Suggested software to use is After Effects. Workshops will be done for After Effects too.

### Deliverables

* Video
    * 1920 x 1080
    * 25 FPS
    * MP4
    * Minimum 90 seconds long (2250 frames)
* Learning Journal
    * Documentation of projects development

### Word Vomit

I thought it'd be a good idea to write down ideas as they come to me - word vomit - and see if anything sticks or can be developed.

<div class="row row-gap-3">

        <i>
            About how trapping my room can feel, especially at night. Maybe it could start off in a dark noisy familiar space that closes in, I could fly out the window into the beauty of the outside fresh air with street stuff flying by and then going into nature with moss and branches and running water. I could make sounds and music for it and take photos for all the assets myself.

            I could create my imaginary perfect place that my mind could transform into (imagining brain and soul and stuff transforming into calming fields with green fields, warm sunbeams, peaceful creatures, nice wind. Nooks and crannies to relax in. Convey comfortableness I could feel there).

        <i>
            Running through the woods as a creature running from all the overwhelming bad and people and memories that are chasing me. Maybe spinning around feeling and visuals and a weight. A anxious fuzziness. I could jump over a river into another world.

        <i>
            Reaching out to someone but not being able to touch them, like they're an infinitely deep fractal with no area, like the Menger Sponge. Imagining an arm reaching out to touch it but never being able to touch it. Maybe this isn't how it works...

            Jumping different parts of life like sitting in bed, dancing to music, cooking, walking somewhere, brushing teeth..

            Wrapped up in a duvet sleeping next to someone so precious. Sleeping and waking up seeing them numerous times in the night. Switching between dreams and seeing them. Comforting music.

            A video of erupting from inside brain through meaty bars, through my skin, to my room, from the familiarness of my room to the outside.

            Dream where looking at your past self in the eyes, they hold you and slowly kill you while grinning with total white blank eyes.

    <div class="col-6">
        <i>
            A video of a fawn travelling through the world - empty city streets with ghostly noise of people, woods that feel they're watching or uncanny - with an overlooming fuzzyness upon the fawns atmosphere and soul. The fawn wants to find a place of sanctuary but it cannot find one. The fawn is falling. 
        </i>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
        <i>
            A video about nature and how I feel it heals me and makes me feel free, compared to the busy city life where it feels sort of lonely and disconnected. I could do the journey of a deer that wanders out of the city and gets on a train and ends up in lovely places like Glenmoss and Lochwinnoch Nature Reserve, where feels free with the beauty of nature. I could make the deer cartoony, but could change its art style depending on its mood. I could overlay nice patterns and shapes into lovely areas. Maybe make gloomy places with fog and noise. I want to show how much my solo journeys to places have meant to me.

### Reflection

I really like the idea of showing the journey of an animal (thinking a fawn deer) going on a train from Glasgow and walking to somewhere nice and relaxing there. I could combine aspects of feeling trappedness to show the development of the mood of the deer as it moves from the city to nature to feeling free.

I think it could be cool to initially give the deer just a line drawing with line boil, and by the end it's coloured in. I could put other things in the video like foliage around the platform or scenes flying by outside the train window.

Here's how I think it could go:
* Deer in bed in my bedroom
* Deer makes it down a Glasgow street
* Is on a platform in central
* Gets on the train and is pictured laying down across two seats
* Wanders down a footpath within a bunch of trees
* Relaxes somewhere on the floor next to a lake
