# Research

For the word Process for design domain, I had explored numerous different types of processes. I was thinking of computer processes (quite related to our course) and other processes such as people walking, mental processes in the brain and emergence.

## Emergence

I settled into exploring emergence and self organisation more.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
    Birds flocking in the air creating amazing shapes is emergent behaviour. The individual birds do not intend for these to form, they are following their own rules that make the shape emerge.
    </div>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Birds flocking</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure class="figure col-6">
        <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/502d2cede4b0ab396711e089/1372187069315-2BIV3LW8H66Z3LG8MA2C/cathedralmound1000.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Termite mounds">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Termite mounds</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class="col-6">
    Termites creating mounds are amazing and massive sculptures that are an example of self organisation.
    </div>

    <div class="col-6">
    Conway's Game of Life follows 4 simple neighbour rules for it's cells and can emerge amazing shapes from it's initial state. This is emergent and complex. Conway's Game of Life can be made in itself.
    </div>

    </figure>

    <figure class="figure col-6">
        <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90aedf870f5e4e462e956c9231fe4ca518599bb3/0_152_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=a36cfba51f3145992ff77a436bf229b4" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Desire Paths">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Desire Paths</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class="col-6">
    Desire paths are created from a desire for people to get from point A to point B in the way the want, maybe from seeing pretty views or simply just wanting to be quick. As time goes on these paths form from repeated troddening, and more follow in the path as it forms.
    </div>
</div>

# Idea

I want to do something with seeing processes that are usually hidden, I also want something interactive. I have lots of spare black thread. I was thinking that I could make something where people use string that maybe causes some human emergence or something to notice patterns in people's behaviour.

I discussed in a tutorial my idea and they seemed confident in it so I develop it.

## Creating the idea

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
    I drew this diagram for an idea of what it could look like. An obelisk looking object with thread on a spool and connections to connect the thread too. Something sort of authoritive.
    </div>
    <figure class="figure col-6">
        <img src="{{ page.assetdir }}/diagram.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Diagram of idea">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Diagram of idea</figcaption>
    </figure>

    
    <figure class="figure col-6">
        <img src="{{ page.assetdir }}/making it.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Creating the prototype">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Creating the prototype</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class="col-6">
    I got a spare bit of wood cut out in the Reid workshop into a square. I needed to nail the nails in a circle sectioned into 12. I thought instead of using protractor I'd just print off a circle with crosses where it needed to go. I stuck it in the center of the wood and nailed on the crosses and it worked, creating a circle. The nails weren't all the same level or exactly where they needed to be but it's good enough for a prototype.
    </div>

    <div class="col-6">
    I put this prototype on a table with a note saying to "Do whatever you want with the pegs and the thread". The prototype was contributed to by many people, eventually forming patterns and unexpected turns.
    </div>
    <figure class="figure col-6">
        <img src="{{ page.assetdir }}/test.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Prototype being tested">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Prototype being tested</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

# Proposal

Here is the written submitted proposal for Design Domain Part 1.

<object data="{{ page.assetdir }}/proposal.pdf" width="100%" height="500px" type='application/pdf'></object>

# Open Studio

I displayed the proposal in printed form set up on a table with my prototype and lighting.

    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Image of the open studio set up for design domain</figcaption>
</figure>

# Conclusion

I think the exploring of what to do for Process turned out great and I am confident in Design Domain Part 2 that I will be able to develop the idea I made with the prototype and explore more ways to do it.
