# Introduction

For Open Share I'd like to revisit my Audio Visual project. I had worked further on my Audio Visual project and exhibited it in The Vic Project Space, but learning from that I want to revisit it.

I'd like to make it more intimate, most likely with just 1 headphones and 1 seat. I'd also like it in a corner and or a dark space. The intimacy of the viewing experience is important as the piece is quite intimate and personal. 

I'd also like to capture better documentation for my website. I have created a [page](https://allyradomski.art/work/peacelove) on my website I want to work on further. To include a video of captured CRT perhaps or maybe an edited version of the video file to give CRT like experience, although that wouldn't be as genuine.
