# Introduction

For Open Share I'd like to revisit my Audio Visual project. I had worked further on my Audio Visual project and exhibited it in The Vic Project Space, but learning from that I want to revisit it.

I'd like to make it more intimate, most likely with just 1 headphones and 1 seat. I'd also like it in a corner and or a dark space. The intimacy of the viewing experience is important as the piece is quite intimate and personal. 

I'd also like to capture better documentation for my website. I have created a [page](https://allyradomski.art/work/peacelove) on my website I want to work on further. To include a video of captured CRT perhaps or maybe an edited version of the video file to give CRT like experience, although that wouldn't be as genuine.


# Getting the things

My first try was the media studio, I went on Connect2 and it said the Digilogic CRT and the Brightsigns were available, but I couldn't book them out to give them back next week. I went to speak to them at the Bureau but basically nothing can be done.

I have checked Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace, Ebay, Shpock and other marketplaces and couldn't find any for a price I can afford.

# Reason for CRT TV

The reason I wanted a CRT TV is because the aspect ratio is usually 4:3, which fits my camera (Canon PowerShot A450) which takes photos in 4:3. Another reason is because I want a TV to match the year when the camera was created, which was 2007. Our family TV we used to have looked liked this.

# Possibe saviour!

I asked Domme if they had any CRTs as I know they have some, they just got back to me saying have a 9", 14" and a 28". The 28" would be too big to transport. They'll get back to me on Thursday afternoon.
