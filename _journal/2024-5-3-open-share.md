# Introduction

For Open Share I'd like to revisit my Audio Visual project. I had worked further on my Audio Visual project and exhibited it in The Vic Project Space, but learning from that I want to revisit it.

I'd like to make it more intimate, most likely with just 1 headphones and 1 seat. I'd also like it in a corner and or a dark space. The intimacy of the viewing experience is important as the piece is quite intimate and personal. 

I'd also like to capture better documentation for my website. I have created a [page](https://allyradomski.art/work/peacelove) on my website I want to work on further. To include a video of captured CRT perhaps or maybe an edited version of the video file to give CRT like experience, although that wouldn't be as genuine.


# Getting the things

My first try was the media studio, I went on Connect2 and it said the Digilogic CRT and the Brightsigns were available, but I couldn't book them out to give them back next week. I went to speak to them at the Bureau but basically nothing can be done.

I have checked Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace, Ebay, Shpock and other marketplaces and couldn't find any for a price I can afford.

# Reason for CRT TV

The reason I wanted a CRT TV is because the aspect ratio is usually 4:3, which fits my camera (Canon PowerShot A450) which takes photos in 4:3. Another reason is because I want a TV to match the year when the camera was created, which was 2007. Our family TV we used to have looked liked this.

# Possibe saviour!

I asked Domme if they had any CRTs as I know they have some, they just got back to me saying have a 9", 14" and a 28". The 28" would be too big to transport. They'll get back to me on Thursday afternoon apparently.

# Paul suggestion

To record a CRT TV (there's a broken one) and edit the image onto the TV to make it convincing, then show this through a HD display. I tried this idea in After Effects with help from [Ben Marriott's CRT file](https://benmarriott.gumroad.com/l/CRTVHS). I used Bezier Warp to place the effect on a static image of a CRT. This looks semi convincing.

I do want this to be kept intimate still though, I wouldn't want it to have a big presence. I could have a smaller TV mounted on a wall with the headphones hanging beside it. I could alternatively have it sitting atop a plynth or table.

# Raspberry Pi

The video plays back well, the audio isnt good though. Using the output from the monitor has better sound than the raspberry pi. I tried to change the audio codec from AAC to MP3 as suggested but it didn't make any difference to the sound output.

# Set up

I set the monitor up on a white stool with connected raspberry pi to an extension cable. I let the headphones hang off a screw on the wall and set up a stool for people to watch the video.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, I am not too happy with this project. I wanted to expand on the exhibition I had previously done but the stars seemed to be very out of line. CRTs and other equipment were unbookable through Connect2 due to degree show preparation, which is totally understandable, but unfortunate! I couldn't source a CRT from anywhere and none in comfortable price range. But I did present something in the end which is most that matters. 

I did enjoy looking around the exhibition and seeing everyone's great works. I especially enjoyed Fedre, Mikhail and Joannes work. It was a nice wrap for the end of year 3.
