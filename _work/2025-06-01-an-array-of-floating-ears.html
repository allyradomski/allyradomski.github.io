<p>
Sound is everywhere.<br>
A vast amalgamated web of sonic processes constantly in flux. <br>
<br>
This work explores the myriad of sonic textures and the processes in which they occur.<br>
<br>
The system explores audio recordings captured around the world and the insides exposed reinforcing the fact that sound is never neutral or isolated.<br>
<br>
Through time, materials, microphones, intent, digitisation, speakers, and our own inner experience there are so many layers of interpretation that happen before the sound reaches us.<br>
<br>
You are not hearing a place, you are hearing an interpretation of it.
