I"Ê<p>Generative installation at Star and Shadow using map data.</p>

<p>â€
Shown are random places throughout Newcastle manipulated with code. The light and dark values of the map are used to create the rippling effect. The image gets increasingly more â€œnoisyâ€ towards the end of its iteration. The grating sounds are designed to match these visuals.
